It is called "invincibleRacoon", I made it prior to this assignment but never used it, and I'm obviously not sharing my password.  
"InvincibleRacoon.github.io" is its name, and it was cloned.  
Clicked "File" and then "Clone repository", and then selected this repository, and then clicked "Clone repository" and then it was done.
